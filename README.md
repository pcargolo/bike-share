# bike-share

# I have completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and did a case study on a fictional bike share company in Chicago, USA. 
# In this repository you'll find three SQL files that I wrote using MySQL, where I set up the database, I clean the data and I analyze it.
# Additionally, I used KNIME to combine the CSV files and you can find a screenshot in this folder of my simple workflow
# My Tableau analysis can be found under this link:
