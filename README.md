# bike-share

# I have completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and did a case study on a bike share company in Chicago, USA. 
# In this repository you'll find three SQL files that I wrote using MySQL, where I set up the database, I clean the data and I analyze it.
# Additionally, you also find the code in R that I wrote to combine the files into one CSV that I could use in my Tableau analysis.
# My Tableau analysis can be found under this link:
